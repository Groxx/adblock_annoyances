# Groxx's ad block list
You're welcome to use it, but I offer absolutely no support :)

## Goals
Block stuff like:
- Reddit's "TRY THIS IN OUR APP ITS WAY BETTER" banner that attempts to make it easy to mis-click "no".
  - Probably also the navbar "use app" button because there's no reason for it to exist.

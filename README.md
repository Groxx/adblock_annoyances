# Groxx's ad block list
You're welcome to use it, but I offer absolutely no support :)
It's probably more mobile-oriented since space is at a premium, thus ads are more annoying to me.

# To use:
The list URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Groxx/adblock_annoyances/master/filter.txt

On mobile:
- Install Firefox for Android.
- Install an adblock-like plugin.  I personally use uBlock Origin.
- Tap on the "...", go to Add-ons -> that adblocker -> options.
- Add the URL above to the custom filters list.
  - In uBlock Origin, go to the "Filter lists" tab, and scroll to the bottom.  There's a "Custom" section.  Tap the tiny "Import..." box and paste in the URL above.
On desktop (basically any browser):
- Install an adblock-like plugin.  Any should work, as long as it lets you use custom filter lists.
- Right-click the extension's icon in your browser's toolbar, choose options / manage / whatever sounds relevant.
- Add the URL above to the custom lists, however it's done in that extension.


## Goals
Block stuff like:
- Reddit's "TRY THIS IN OUR APP ITS WAY BETTER" banner that attempts to make it easy to mis-click "no".
  - Probably also the navbar "use app" button because there's no reason for it to exist.
